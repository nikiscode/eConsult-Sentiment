```cmd
install.bat
```

### Running the Application

**For Windows (Signal Fix Required):**
```cmd
# Method 1: Use Windows batch file (recommended)
 

# Method 2: Use Windows Python script
python start_windows.py

# Method 3: Use Windows-optimized app
streamlit run app_windows.py

# Method 4: Direct run (may have signal issues)
streamlit run app.py
```

**For Linux/macOS:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Access the Application
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
- The application will automatically load AI models (may take a few minutes on first run)

### üîß Windows Signal Fix

If you encounter "signal only works in main thread" error on Windows:

1. **Use the Windows batch file** (recommended):
   ```cmd
   start_windows.bat
   ```

2. **Use the Windows Python script**:
   ```cmd
   python start_windows.py
   ```

3. **Use the Windows-optimized app**:
   ```cmd
   streamlit run app_windows.py
   ```

These methods automatically set the required environment variables to prevent threading and signal issues on Windows.
